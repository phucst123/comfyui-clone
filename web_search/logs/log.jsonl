It can also be asked to sleep and wait for pages to load, in cases where the pages seem to be taking a while to load.\nfile_surfer: An agent that can handle local files.\n\n\n\nHere is an initial fact sheet to consider:\n\n1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS\n   - The model name to download is ThinkDiffusionXL.safetensors.\n   - The websites specified for downloading are HuggingFace and Civitai.\n   - The intended download folder is /home/hungquan/comfyui-clone/web_search/download_folder.\n\n2. FACTS TO LOOK UP\n   - Verification of the availability of the ThinkDiffusionXL.safetensors model on HuggingFace or Civitai.\n\n3. FACTS TO DERIVE\n   - None specifically mentioned.\n\n4. EDUCATED GUESSES\n   - The process of downloading and verifying files is generally a technical operation that involves checking file existence in the specified directory.\n\n\n\nHere is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n\n- **WebSurfer**: \n  1. Check the availability of the ThinkDiffusionXL.safetensors model on the HuggingFace and Civitai websites.\n  2. Attempt to download the model from the available website.\n  3. Download the model and ensure it is saved to the specified directory: /home/hungquan/comfyui-clone/web_search/download_folder.\n\n- **file_surfer**:\n  4. Verify the existence of the ThinkDiffusionXL.safetensors file in the specified download folder.\n  5. Return \"Found the model\" if the file is located, otherwise return \"Can not find the model\". \n\nThe task assignments ensure that each team member focuses on their specialized skills: WebSurfer with internet navigation and downloading, and file_surfer with file operations on the local system.\n\n", "type": "OrchestrationEvent"}
