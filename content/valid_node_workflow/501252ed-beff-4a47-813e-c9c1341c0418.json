{"description": "This is a workflow for the ComfyUI implementation of Omost as seen on their Github.\n\nhttps://github.com/huchenlei/ComfyUI_omost\n\nhttps://github.com/lllyasviel/Omost\n\nThis is a lightning version using my custom lightning model but can obviously be swapped out for any SDXL, Lightning or SD 1.5 models, just have to change the generation parameters and
